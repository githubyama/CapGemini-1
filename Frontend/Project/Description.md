# Project - Frontend

## What

Techniques: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Make a **component**

The component should contain a couple of form elements such as
- date selector
- text box
- radio button
- checkbox
- button
- select box
- textarea
- color picker
- range

Focus more on **Javascript** than CSS.
